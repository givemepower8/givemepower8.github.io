This site logs Wei's technical notes in the lifelong learning journey.

Note is different from tutorials or books:

- the main audience of the notes is the author
- notes should be short
- notes only cover one small topic at a time

You might find this site is useful or useless. I wish you can learn something from the site anyway. ;-)
