<p>Technologies evolve fast. I have a vast range of interests in web technologies, back-end and front-end. Best ways to
    keep up with is to practice, write and teach. Github is my test-bed for new things and GitHub Pages is the place I
    write technical notes. I hope you can learn something new with me everyday.</p>
