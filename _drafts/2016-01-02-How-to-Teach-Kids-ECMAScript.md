# How to Teach Kids ECMAScript

## Basics - the whole picture of the web

At the first stage, help the kids get familiar with the terms and have a basic understanding of the whole picture:

* HTML, assets like images
* CSS styling
* Web server, HTTP request and response
* JavaScript, ECMAScript, TypeScript
* DOM elements and events
* Browser or node.js which runs ECMAScript
* Development tools like Visual Studio Code
