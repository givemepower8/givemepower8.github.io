## CLI

`npm -v`

`npm help`

By default, npm is installed with a fresh installation of nodejs.

If you only have nodejs installed already, use `npm install -g npm` to install npm.

To upgrade npm to the latest, use the following:
`npm i -g npm@latest`

`npm set strict-ssl false`

init
`npm init` will prompt you for the options and create the package.json file based on your input.

`npm init -yes` will not prompt for options and use the defaults.

`npm audit fix` and `npm audit`

### Install

`npm install --save-dev browserify`

-g global

--save-dev is used to save the package for development purpose. Example: unit tests, minification. devDependencies includes build tools such as Babel and webpack. Packages in the devDependencies section of package.json don't get installed when the NODE_ENV variable is set to production.

--save is used to save the package required for the application to run. dependencies include any libraries that are required to run the application.

-D is short for --save-dev and -S is short for --save
