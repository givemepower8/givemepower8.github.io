# npm

The JavaScript ecosystem provides many great libraries and tools to make writing applications faster and easier for developers. Most of them are managed in npm.

## CLI

[npm-cli-commands](https://devdocs.io/npm-cli-commands/)

`npm help`

By default, npm is installed with a fresh installation of nodejs.

If you only have nodejs installed already, use `npm install -g npm` to install npm.

To upgrade npm to the latest, use the following:
`npm i -g npm@latest`

`npm set strict-ssl false`

init
`npm init` will prompt you for the options and create the package.json file based on your input.

`npm init -yes` will not prompt for options and use the defaults.

`npm audit fix` and `npm audit`

## Package Management

### Install and update npm

npm version and update
`npm -v`

`npm install npm@latest -g`

### Install a package

#### Environment

##### prov vs dev

The `--save`, `--save-prod` and `--save-dev` install flags installs the package in prod or dev environment.

--save-dev is used to save the package for development purpose. Example: unit tests, minification. devDependencies includes build tools such as Babel and webpack. Packages in the devDependencies section of package.json don't get installed when the NODE_ENV variable is set to production.

--save is used to save the package required for the application to run. dependencies include any libraries that are required to run the application.

-D is short for --save-dev and -S is short for --save

[What is the difference between --save and --save-dev?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22891211/what-is-the-difference-between-save-and-save-dev)

One difference is the dependencies and devDependencies section used in package.json.

> Please do not put test harnesses or transpilers in your dependencies object. Use devDependencies for that purpose.

A perfect example of this is: `npm install typescript --save-dev`

In this case, you would want to have Typescript available for development, but once the app is deployed, it is no longer necessary, as all of the code has been transpiled to javascript. As such, it would make no sense to include it in the published app. Indeed, it would only take up space and increase download times.

`--save` or `--save-prod` is assumed by default.

To specify dev environment `npm install <package_name> --save-dev` for example, `npm install browserify --save-dev`

`npm install moment --save`

This would create a new value in your package.json

```json
"dependencies": {
   ...
   "moment": "^2.17.1"
}
```

When you are developing, it really helps to use tools such as test suites and may need jasmine-core and karma. In this case you would use

`npm install jasmine-core --save-dev`
`npm install karma --save-dev`

This would also create a new value in your package.json

```json
"devDependencies": {
    ...
    "jasmine-core": "^2.5.2",
    "karma": "^1.4.1",
}
```

You do not need the test suite to run the app in its normal state, so it is a `--save-dev` type dependency, nothing more. You can see how if you do not understand what is really happening, it is a bit hard to imagine.

-g global

### list the packages

list all the packages installed with version number
`npm list --depth=0`

## update the packages

run `npm update` in the same directory as the package.json file of the application that you want to update.

Run `npm outdated`. There should not be any results.

`npm update pug --save`

## uninstall

## package.json

`npm help json`
