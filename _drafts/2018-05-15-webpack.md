# webpack

> At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

[Concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

[Guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides)

[Boilerplate](https://github.com/metagrover/ES6-boilerplate)

## Install

make sure npm is initialized or packages.json is ready.

`npm install --save-dev webpack`

`npm install --save-dev webpack-cli`

`npm install --save-dev webpack-node-externals`

## CLI

`npx webpack` for building for development environment.

`npx webpack -p` for building for production environment.

## webpack.config.js

If you don't specify a config file, webpack.config.js will be used.

`npx webpack --config webpack.config.js`

a typical config.js file looks like:

```js
'use strict';

const webpack = require('webpack');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',

  mode: 'development',

  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
    publicPath: '/build/',
    filename: 'project.bundle.js'
  },

  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: [/\.vert$/, /\.frag$/],
        use: 'raw-loader'
      }
    ]
  },

  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      CANVAS_RENDERER: JSON.stringify(true),
      WEBGL_RENDERER: JSON.stringify(true)
    })
  ]
};
```

### Environment

mode option in webpack.config.js file.

`mode: 'development',`

If the 'mode' option is not set, webpack will fallback to 'production' for this value.

use `webpack.development.config.js` or `webpack.production.config.js` for building in different environments.

## package.json

you can create npm script for webpack.

```json
"scripts": {
"start": "webpack-dev-server --hot --inline",
"watch": "webpack -w -d",
"build": "webpack -p"
},
```

`npm start` to run a dev server at localhost:8080 and watch for recompile on changes.
`npm run watch` to only watch for/recompile on changes on your own web-server.
`npm run build` to generate a minified, production-ready build.

## Loaders

`npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader`

`npm install --save-dev file-loader`

`npm install --save-dev csv-loader xml-loader`
