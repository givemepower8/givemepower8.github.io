# How to Teach Kids ECMAScript

## Basics - the whole picture of the web

At the first stage, you need to help the kids get familiar with the terms and have a basic understanding of the whole picture:

- HTML, assets like images
- CSS styling
- DOM elements and events
- Web server, DNS basics
- HTTP request and response
- JavaScript, ECMAScript, TypeScript
- Browser or node.js which runs ECMAScript
- Development tools like Visual Studio Code

### Variables

[Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables)

#### var, let, const and scope

#### Variable type

| Type                                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Bool](https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/boolean)                                    | A True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords in JS, and don't need quotes.                              |
| [Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math)            | A number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.                                                                             |
| [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings)         | A sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, you must enclose it in quote marks.             |
| [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) | A structure that allows you to store multiple values in one single reference.                                                |
| [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects)                    | Basically, anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object, and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn. |

#### Naming conventions

### Statements

[Control flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)

### Functions

### Array

### Troubleshooting

> “To err is human.”

Type of errors, easy-to-catch ones are typos, language syntax, variable not accessible, wrong returns.

Hard-to-catch ones are logic ones. The code compiles and works for most of the scenarios but returns wrong values for some cases.

### Error handling

## Beyond the basics

### Regex

## Environment setup

- install nodeJS
- install git
- install chrome
- install visual studio code
- get an account on GitHub
