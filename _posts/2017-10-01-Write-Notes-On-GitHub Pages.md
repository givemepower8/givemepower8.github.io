# How to use GitHub Pages to take notes

Used BBEdit and `<blink>` element in the past, I had been playing around with different rapidly evolving [web technologies in the past](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history). During the years, I had been taking notes in OneNote, various word documentations, other web sites and all over the place. I like GitHub Pages the best.

GitHub Pages is using Jekyll, a static site generator, that takes Markdown files and converts them to a website. Usually it's a great way for writing blogs. But not like blogs, I enjoy coming back often to maintain the notes here. This site is to keep my technical notes while I am learning new web technologies. Hopefully they will be useful for you, too.

CodeSandbox and other online editors provide great features to present the code in an embedded iframe as following.

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/reactjs-v9xipw?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
     title="reactJS"
     allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>
