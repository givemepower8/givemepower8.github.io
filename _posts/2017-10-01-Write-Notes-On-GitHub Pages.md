# How to use GitHub Pages to take notes

Used BBEdit and `<blink>` element in the past, I had been playing around with different rapidly evolving [web technologies in the past](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history). During the years, I had been taking notes in OneNote, various word documentations, other web sites and all over the place. I like GitHub Pages the best.

GitHub Pages is using Jekyll, a static site generator, that takes Markdown files and converts them to a website. Usually it's a great way for writing blogs. But not like blogs, I enjoy coming back often to maintain the notes here. This site is to keep my technical notes while I am learning new web technologies. Hopefully they will useful for you, too.
