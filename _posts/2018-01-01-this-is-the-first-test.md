# Blogging on GitHub Page

## Jekyll

>[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
>
>Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
>
>It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) renderer, and renders out a complete, ready-to-publish static website.
