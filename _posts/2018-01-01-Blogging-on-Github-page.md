## Jekyll

>[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
>
>Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
>
>It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) renderer, and renders out a complete, ready-to-publish static website.

### Common tasks

[YAML](https://yaml.org/) [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is used to configure the posts and pages.

[Permanent links](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) is used to instruct how the urls are generated.

[Default github page Themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/) has built-in features and you still can [customize CSS and HTML in themes](https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/).

## Liquid

> Safe, customer-facing template language for flexible web apps.

Liquid use double curly braces to render content.

Curly braces and percent signs create the logic and control flow for templates.
